# CollatzStoppingTime
Overview:
The following is a test respository to help learn Git/GitHub. The given project provides a program with helpful functions related to the stopping time of the Collatz Conjecture.

Use:
 python3 CollatzStoppingTime.py [useNum] [input]
 (Refer to useNum table below)
 (Example: "~: python3 CollatzStoppingTime.py 2 100" calculates the highest stopping time from 1 to 100)

 useNum:
 1: Calculate the stopping time of the given input
 2: Calculate the highest stopping time from 1 to the given input
 3: Calculate a traceable list of steps in the conjecture given a starting value
